 Simple memory game - flipping cards and trying to find a pair.

Exercise:
Create a new application and use ConstraintLayout as root group view. Implement a
picture memory game with 12 images (3x4) in it. In addition of the images there
should be places for views showing message like “You guessed all, great work” and
a “START AGAIN” button.
